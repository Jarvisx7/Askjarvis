About Askjarvis.
Askjarvis is a trick you can play on your friends to freak them out. All you need is a couple of minutes and an unsuspecting friend! Set up your friend(s) by telling them that jarvis is a virtual tarot that can answer any question they ask, but only you know the magic that makes him answer.

Ask your friend for a question to ask Jarvis, or better yet, pose a question of your own. 
If your friends think of a question you know the answer to, proceed to the next step, otherwise, just enter "Jarvis, please answer:" and fill in the question. Jarvis will answer with a general answer such as "I cannot establish a spiritual link". Not a problem, just try again and when you come up with a question to which you know the answer, just go to the next step. 

Begin entering the standard petition (which is "Jarvis, please answer:") 
into the "petition" box. In the beginning of the petition box, type the answer of the quesion what you r going to type. This is where the magic will happen, instead of a answer inserted into the petition box, you will see a capital "J",and then when the answer ends add period that is full stop.

then type the ques and see the magic.
